# ExtFormer 
ExtFormer is an open-source library focusing on time series forecasting using transformer variants. The existing transformer models are extended to use the static dataset which is generally useful to make accurate predictions.


The existing transformer models does not take care of sttaic data intrinsicly in the model architenture. The goal here is to extend the models architecture which emable them to use the static data and improve the predictions.

The codebase is motivated from Time Series Analysis (developer of TimesNet).
